Roadmap
=============

For now, I'm going to keep the roadmap packaged with the project. The purpose
of this file is to keep from building out the nuances of each minor release in
the issue tracker until they are going to be worked on.

This document is in constant flux, and no feature mentioned is guaranteed to be
included at any point, and the timing is simply an estimate.

To submit an idea, please [create an
issue](https://github.com/seancdavis/sapwood/issues/new) and prepend it with
`[request]`.

v1.5: File Management & Developer Help (May/June 2015)
-------------

Most aspects of the builder have been given sufficient attention since their
initial release. But, other than switching to Dragonfly, we haven't done much
with the media library. This release will focus on sites' libraries.

#### Galleries / Categories

Files will be able to be grouped together for better organization for your
site's files.

#### File Attributes

You will be able to capture and customize much more information about a file
you upload.

#### Cropper UI

The file cropper settings are tucked away and difficult to find. They will be
moved to the media library, and the process of cropping will be made a little
cleaner.

### Form Helpers

We're going to replace form notes with helper tooltips. This should make forms
much easier to digest and show you help items only if you need them.

### UI Cleanup

We've added a lot in the last few months. It's time to give the UI a quick
touch-up.

v1.6: Setup & Theming (May/June 2015)
----------

*TBD: Aims to remove some of the duplication in setup and streamlines the
writing code process.*

v1.7: Editor App (June/July 2015)
----------

*TBD: Features to make editing a site simpler.*

v2.0: Separating Functional Apps & Documentation (Late 2015)
----------

*2.0 will introduce a fully-documented API and will be an organized package of
self-hosted applications, as building, developing and viewing will all be
managed by separate applications.*
