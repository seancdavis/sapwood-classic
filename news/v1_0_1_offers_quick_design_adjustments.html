    <p>v1.0.1 was released yesterday. Along with some minor bug fixes, it introduced some design changes and a couple small feature adds.</p>

<p>While big design improvements are at least usually part of a minor release, we added them to a patch because we were seeing some confusion in navigation right out of the gate.</p>

<h2 id="reorganized-navigation">Reorganized Navigation</h2>

<p>Instead of working with icons and confusing submenus on the left side of the screen, we decided to make it more apparent how we were breaking up the navigation.</p>

<h3 id="site-navigation">Site Navigation</h3>

<p>We&#39;ve placed the <em>site navigation</em> in a horizontal bar across the top of the page when you are within a particular site, and we&#39;re now using labels instead of icons for each of these items.</p>

<h3 id="feature-navigation">Feature Navigation</h3>

<p>Meanwhile, sub-navigation menus are subject to the particular feature or space within the site builder that you are viewing. We&#39;ve moved these to the righthand side of the page and nestled them under the page title.</p>

<p>Together, separating and rethinking these menus makes it a little easier to move around. But, we know we don&#39;t have it perfect yet, so if you have ideas <a href="https://github.com/seancdavis/sapwood/issues/new">we want to hear them</a>.</p>

<h3 id="form-tabs">Form Tabs</h3>

<p>Tabs within forms have also been redesigned to make them stand out from the rest of the form content. This should make moving around a form a little easier.</p>

<h2 id="ordering-pages-by-position">Ordering Pages by Position</h2>

<p>Previously, we had only enabled pages to be ordered by position if they were root level pages. And, because of that, we hid the position field on nested pages. Now, if a page type is to be ordered by <code>position</code>, then the <code>position</code> field will appear in the nested form.</p>

<h2 id="site-specific-settings">Site-Specific Settings</h2>

<p>Site settings can now be accessed via the <code>site_settings</code> helper method in any of your template files.</p>
