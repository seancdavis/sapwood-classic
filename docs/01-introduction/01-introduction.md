Welcome to Sapwood's documentation. With this project being small and young, the documentation is among the first pass at explaining how to use the app. As this product grows and matures, it will become easier to use, and the docs will continue to hone in on how to teach it.

If you are brand new to sapwood and really want to learn, we've set up the documentation to work essentially like a book - you can simply make your way sequentially through the chapters and sections.

Most of all, if you can't find an answer, [ask a question](https://github.com/seancdavis/sapwood/issues/new).

Enjoy!
