Taproot
=============

Taproot is a self-hosted content management system for managing several sites
under the same system and on the same server.

We're not yet to the full public release, but we're close! Until we have a
completed site, you can reference documentation
[here](https://github.com/rocktree/taproot/tree/docs).
