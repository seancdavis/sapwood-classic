# Site Config
# =================
# 
# This file is storing for all your site-specific configuration.
# 
# The values here are loaded into a nested OpenStruct, available from the
# SiteSetting class, per environment. For example, if you have a config like
# this:
# 
# development: &default
#   social:
#     facebook: "https://www.facebook.com/I_Am_Awesome"
# 
# Then you would get "https://www.facebook.com/I_Am_Awesome" by running:
# 
#     SiteSettings.social.facebook
